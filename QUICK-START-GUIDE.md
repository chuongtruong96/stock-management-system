# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Image Migration to Cloudinary

## Step 1: Get Your API Secret

1. Go to your Cloudinary dashboard
2. Click **"View API Keys"** button
3. Copy the **API Secret** (long string of characters)

## Step 2: Update Environment Variables

1. Open the `.env` file in your project root
2. Replace `your_actual_api_secret_here` with your actual API secret:

```env
# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dha0szuzq
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=849416719383161
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=paste_your_api_secret_here
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd "D:\PMH Products\Stationery-Stock-mngt-system\stationery-mgnt-system"
npm install
```

## Step 4: Test Connection

```bash
npm run test-cloudinary
```

You should see: `✅ Cloudinary connection successful`

## Step 5: Run Migration

```bash
npm run migrate
```

This will:
- Upload all your images to Cloudinary
- Generate a mapping file
- Create SQL update statements

## Step 6: Update Database

1. Find the generated SQL file (e.g., `image-migration-updates-2024-01-01T12-00-00-000Z.sql`)
2. Run the SQL statements on your database to update image URLs

## Step 7: Deploy

### For Render (Backend):
Add these environment variables in Render dashboard:
```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dha0szuzq
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=849416719383161
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
```

### For Netlify (Frontend):
Add this environment variable:
```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://your-render-backend-url.onrender.com
```

## Expected Output

After running the migration, you should see something like:

```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Connection failed"
- Check your API secret is correct
- Make sure you have internet connection
- Verify your Cloudinary account is active

### Error: "Directory not found"
- Make sure you're running the script from the correct directory
- Check that `BE/uploads/` directory exists

### Error: "Upload failed"
- Check file permissions
- Verify image files are not corrupted
- Check Cloudinary account limits

## What Happens Next?

1. **Your images are now in the cloud** ☁️
2. **They have CDN URLs** for fast global delivery 🌍
3. **They're automatically optimized** for web 🚀
4. **They won't disappear** when you deploy 🔒

## Sample Cloud URLs

Your images will have URLs like:
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/dha0szuzq/image/upload/v1234567890/stationery-mgmt/products/1.jpg
https://res.cloudinary.com/dha0szuzq/image/upload/v1234567890/stationery-mgmt/categories/office.png
```
