# Order Workflow UX Improvements

## Problem Statement

The original order workflow had several UX gaps that made it difficult for users to complete their orders:

1. **Missing Upload Button**: After exporting PDF, users didn't know where to upload their signed PDF
2. **No Clear Next Steps**: Users were confused about what to do after each step
3. **Navigation Issues**: No easy way to return to order-form from order-history
4. **Lost Context**: Users couldn't easily find and continue their pending orders

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced OrderDetail Page** ✅

**File**: `fe/src/pages/User/Orders/OrderDetail.jsx`

**Improvements**:
- **Added Upload Signed PDF Button**: Shows when order status is 'exported'
- **Added Submit Order Button**: Shows when order status is 'uploaded'
- **Added Continue in Order Form Button**: Always available for easy navigation
- **Integrated UploadSignedDialog**: Full upload functionality directly from order details
- **Status-Aware Actions**: Different buttons appear based on order status

**New Features**:
```jsx
{order.status === 'exported' && (
  <Button onClick={() => setUpOpen(true)}>
    Upload Signed PDF
  </Button>
)}

{order.status === 'uploaded' && (
  <Button onClick={handleSubmitOrder}>
    Submit Order to Admin
  </Button>
)}

<Button onClick={() => navigate('/order-form')}>
  Continue in Order Form
</Button>
```
